This document contains a summary of my efforts to complete the final project for the Programming and Scripting module, along with observations  about the dataset and the references used to complete it. 

## Project Abstract 

My goal with this project is to analyze the Fisherâ€™s Iris data set and reach to a set of conclusions using Python. In order to analyze this dataset, I will use the knowledge I have gained during the completion of this module along with extra resources which I will document here for reference.

## Summary of dataset  

**1.History:**

This dataset was created in 1936 by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher.
The set is composed of a total of 150 instances, 50 for each of the 3 species which refer to a type of iris plant (iris setosa, iris versicolor & iris virginica). 

For those who are not familiar with the two main concepts of this dataset, see definitions below:

*Sepal: This is one of the parts of the flower which forms the outer part surrounding the petals.*
*Petal: This part of the flower consists of the brightly coloured parts that together will form most of the flower.* 

**2.Data set variables:** 

The way the date is organised is as follows.
First we have an ID column for every flower analysed, then we have  four columns with the different flower parts measures in centimeters and the fifth column is the species of the flower observed.  

ID
Sepal.Length (This is the length of the sepal of flower)  
Sepal.Width (This is the width of the sepal of the flower)  
Petal.Length (This is the length of the petal of the flower)  
Petal.Width (This is the width of the petal of the flower)  
Species (Species name)

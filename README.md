This document contains a summary of my efforts to complete the final project for the Programming and Scripting module, along with observations  about the dataset and the references used to complete it. 

##**Project Abstract**  

My goal with this project is to analyze the Fisherâ€™s Iris data set and reach to a set of conclusions using Python. In order to analyze this dataset, I will use the knowledge I have gained during the completion of this module along with extra resources which I will document here for reference.  

Iris Data set downloaded from : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris (UCI Machine Learning) 

##**Summary of dataset**  

**1.History:**

This dataset was created in 1936 by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher.
The set is composed of 150 instances for 3 classes which refer to a type of iris plant (iris setosa, iris versicolor & iris virginica). 

For those who are not familiar with the two main concepts of this dataset, see definitions below:

*Sepal: This is one of the parts of the flower which forms the outer part surrounding the petals.*
*Petal: This part of the flower consists of the brightly coloured parts that together will form most of the flower.* 

**2.Data set variables:** 

SepalLengthCm (This is the length of the sepal of flower)
SepalWidthCm (This is the width of the sepal of the flower)
PetalLengthCm (This is the length of the petal of the flower)
PetalWidthCm (This is the width of the petal of the flower)
Species
